# Game-Test: A Pygame Tetris Clone

Welcome to the playground repository for experimenting with Pygame to create a simple yet engaging Tetris clone. This project is designed to explore the capabilities of Pygame by building a complete game from scratch. Below is a roadmap to guide you through the development process, from setting up your environment to packaging and distributing your game.

## Setup Your Environment
- **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **Install Pygame**: Run `pip install pygame` in your terminal to install Pygame.
- **Create a Project Directory**: Make a directory for your project and navigate into it.

## Initialize Pygame
- **Start Pygame**: Initialize Pygame and create a window.
- **Set Game Variables**: Define variables for screen size, colors, frame rate, etc.

## Create Game Grid
- **Define Grid Size**: Decide on the number of rows and columns.
- **Draw Grid**: Create a function to draw the grid on the screen.

## Tetrominoes (Game Pieces)
- **Define Shapes**: Create a list of Tetris shapes (T, S, Z, I, O, J, L) using matrix representations.
- **Shape Colors**: Assign colors to each shape.
- **Rotation**: Implement a function to rotate the shapes.

## Game Mechanics
- **Falling Pieces**: Implement the logic for pieces falling down the grid.
- **Movement**: Allow the player to move (left/right) and rotate the pieces.
- **Collision Detection**: Check for collisions with the grid boundaries and stacked pieces.
- **Line Clear**: Detect and remove completed lines from the grid.
- **Game Over**: Detect when the stack of pieces reaches the top of the grid.

## Game Loop
- **Initialize Pygame Loop**: Create the main game loop where the game updates.
- **Event Handling**: Process keyboard inputs for moving and rotating pieces.
- **Update Game State**: Move the falling piece, check for collisions, and update the grid.
- **Render**: Draw the current state of the game to the screen.

## Scoring and Levels
- **Scoring System**: Implement a scoring system based on the number of lines cleared at once.
- **Leveling Up**: Increase the falling speed of the pieces as the score or level increases.

## Add Game Over Screen
- **Display Message**: Show a game over message when the game ends.
- **Restart Option**: Allow the player to restart the game after losing.

## Polish and Refinement
- **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for line clears, game over, and piece movements.
- **Graphics**: Improve the game's visual appeal with background images and better colors.
- **User Interface**: Add a score display, next piece preview, and level indicator.

## Testing and Debugging
- **Playtest**: Play the game yourself and fix any bugs.
- **Optimization**: Optimize the game's performance if necessary.

## Packaging and Distribution
- **Create Executable**: Use tools like PyInstaller to package your game into an executable.
- **Share Your Game**: Distribute your game to others to enjoy.

Dive into the world of game development with this Tetris clone project. Happy coding!
